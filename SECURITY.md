# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

ProjectCLI is a CLI tool. Security fixes are released on the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately.

- Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories (Private Vulnerability Report) on the repository.
- If you cannot use advisories, open a GitHub issue with **only high-level details**, and we will follow up.

Please include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

We will do our best to respond quickly and coordinate a fix.
